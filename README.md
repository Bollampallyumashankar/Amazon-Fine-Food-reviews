Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning and Text Featurization(BOW, tfidf, Avg-Word2Vec and tfidf-W-W2V). Build several ML models like KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest & GBDT, Decision Trees, K-Means, Agglomerative & DBSCAN Clustering, The purpose of this analysis is to make up a prediction model where we will be able to predict whether a recommendation is positive or negative. In this analysis, we will not focus on the Score, but only the positive/negative sentiment of the recommendation.
